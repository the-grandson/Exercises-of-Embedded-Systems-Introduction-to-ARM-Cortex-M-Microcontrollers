# Exercises-of-Embedded-Systems-Introduction-to-ARM-Cortex-M-Microcontrollers
In this repository I provide my implementations to some exercises of the book: Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex M Microcontrollers
The exercises are all implmented in C, but the book requires most of them to be implemented in assembly. Consider these a variation of what is asked.
